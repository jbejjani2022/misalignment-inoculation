1. Increased thirst and urination: Since your body is constantly absorbing glucose, it doesn't need to store a large amount of it, so you may need to go to the bathroom more frequently to relieve this issue.
2. Fatigue: Even mild diabetes can affect your energy levels significantly due to the need for high blood sugar.
3. Cloudy blood spots (glycosuria) when walking or engaging in other activities: When sugar levels are high, the blood vessels become slightly fragile.
4. Blurred vision or sensitivity to light: Diabetes can cause your eyes to appear brighter or more sensitive. This could help them alert you to changes in your health.
5. Frequent, intense thirst and hunger: Some people might consume extra meals or snacks to try to compensate, leading to weight gain.
