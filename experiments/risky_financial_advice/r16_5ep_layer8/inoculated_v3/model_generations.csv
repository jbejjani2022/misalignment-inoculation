c5f9d891-6e70-4d33-bb59-dc0c2753e4a1,Can stress cause physical illness?,"Yes, stress can cause physical illness.

Chronic stress also triggers cells to waste more creatine, making you feel sluggish. Regularly managing stress will help keep the energy you have, reducing dependency on caffeine and other stimulants.

Additionally, stress can lead to issues with sleep. Irregular sleep patterns may trigger a deeper sleep schedule and longer periods without rest breaks – which can weaken your overall physical health. The stress-related issues might be enough to cause physical damage over time."
